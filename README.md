## How to submit homework

Create a team on Github in the Organization `Systems-Development-and-Frameworks`
and invite your team members. As a next step, create your own homework
repository and add it to your team.

### Best practices

Make sure that you *watch* the original homework repository. That's where we
update exercise descriptions. Keep your own copy up-to-date by merging in new
commits of the original repository.
